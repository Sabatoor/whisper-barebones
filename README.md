# Barebones Whisper (openAI) Transcriptions
## Rapid Development Project (RAP)

## Overview
Was just wanting to test a quick, local Whisper audio transcriptions package.
Feel free to modify it and use it however you want.

There are two files, main.py and main-v2.py

main.py is the barest file I could imagine.

main-v2.py adds a few extra packages (punkt and... i'll come back to this) to
split sentences up into lines.

## Use at your own risk!
While there are no APIs or .env variables to worry about, I did not create
these packages so I'm unaware of they're sending off your data elsewhere.

The two files I've included are just test mp3 files I grabbed online to see if
it works. It did :D

## Future Considerations
I might come back and have it identify different narrators. That would make it
way more useful. However, if you're just backing up some audio files it'll do
the trick!
